eCollision Analytics quality assessment processes

- take regular (daily) snapshot of the Collision table (this has all we need to check if certain Case Numbers or Collision IDs are missing from Analytics)
- run Python script to identify discrepancies (i.e., Case Numbers that got "deleted" (or are missing) in more recent snapshots than older snapshots (vs 1 day prior, 1 week prior, 1 month prior, 2 months prior)
- check against eCollision and see if these "deleted" (or missing cases) are legitimately removed, otherwise it may be indicative of an underlying process/bug that incorrectly deleted them in eCollision Analytics
- categorize the nature/characteristics of missing cases
- create a CGI ticket to conduct root-cause analysis and change code to rectify the issues
- confirm by continuously run this current process as if the root cause is removed, less or no erroneously deleted/misisng cases should be found
