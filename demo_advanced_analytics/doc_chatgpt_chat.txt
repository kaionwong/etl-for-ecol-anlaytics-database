Ooo this is a great question — and you’re sitting on **perfect data** for it. Collision data is *chef’s kiss* for predictive analytics because it’s high-impact, policy-relevant, and interpretable (which managers actually care about).

I’ll break this into **what to showcase**, **why it’s impressive**, and **how to frame it** so it lands with non-technical stakeholders.

---

## 🧠 Big Picture: What decision are you predicting?

The strongest collision analytics answer **one of these**:

1. **Where** collisions will happen
2. **When** collisions will spike
3. **Who** is at higher risk
4. **How severe** a collision will be
5. **What intervention would reduce risk**

You don’t need all five. **2–3 done well > 5 done shallowly**.

## 🔥 Top Predictive Analytics to Showcase (Ranked)

### 1️⃣ **Collision Risk Scoring (Location-based)**

**“Which road segments/intersections are most likely to see a collision next year?”**

**Why it’s powerful**

* Directly actionable for engineers & policymakers
* Easy to visualize on a map
* Feels “AI-ish” without being a black box

**Model ideas**

* Gradient Boosting / Random Forest
* Poisson or Negative Binomial (counts)
* Spatial lag models (advanced flex)

**Features**

* Historical collisions (by severity)
* Road type / speed limit
* Weather
* Time of day / seasonality
* Traffic volume (if available)

**Output**

* Risk score (0–100)
* Top 5% “high-risk” segments

🧠 *Executive framing*:

> “If we proactively treated the top 5% of segments, we could potentially prevent X% of serious collisions.”

### 2️⃣ **Severe Collision Prediction**

**“Given a collision occurs, how likely is it to be fatal or serious injury?”**

This one **always lands**.

**Target variable**

* Binary or multinomial:

  * PDO vs Injury vs Fatal

**Features**

* Vehicle type (Class 1 👀)
* Speed
* Lighting
* Weather
* Driver age / impairment indicators
* Road geometry

**Models**

* Logistic Regression (for explainability)
* XGBoost / LightGBM (for performance)

**What to showcase**

* Feature importance
* Odds ratios (very manager-friendly)

🧠 *Policy framing*:

> “Darkness + wet road + heavy truck increases fatality odds by 4.3×.”

---

### 3️⃣ **Driver Risk Profiling (Especially Class 1 vs non-Class 1)**

You literally asked about this earlier — great continuity.

**Question**

> “Are certain driver classes more likely to be involved in collisions *after exposure is controlled*?”

**Key insight**
Raw counts lie. Exposure matters.

**Predictive angle**

* Probability of collision per driver-year
* Or per million km traveled

**Models**

* Survival analysis (time-to-collision)
* Hierarchical logistic regression
* Bayesian models (extra spicy 🌶️)

**Showcase**

* Adjusted risk ratios
* Confidence intervals

🧠 *Framing*:

> “After adjusting for exposure and environment, Class 1 drivers are **not / are** at higher risk under these conditions…”

That “after adjusting” phrase = credibility.

---

### 4️⃣ **Temporal Forecasting (Seasonal Spikes)**

**“When should we expect collision surges?”**

This is underrated but extremely practical.

**Targets**

* Monthly serious collisions
* Weekend vs weekday patterns
* Weather-triggered spikes

**Models**

* SARIMA
* Prophet
* LSTM (only if you want flash)

**Output**

* Forecast with confidence bands
* “High-risk months” calendar

🧠 *Ops framing*:

> “We can pre-deploy enforcement and EMS resources 2–3 weeks ahead of peak risk.”

---

### 5️⃣ **What-If / Intervention Simulation (Advanced Showcase)**

This is **senior-exec bait**.

Examples:

* “If speed limits drop by 10 km/h…”
* “If winter tires adoption increases by 15%…”
* “If lighting is improved at intersections…”

**Approach**

* Counterfactual modeling
* Causal inference (DiD, propensity matching)
* Scenario simulations

🧠 *Gold sentence*:

> “This isn’t correlation — this estimates preventable harm.”

---

## 📊 What NOT to Over-Showcase (Common Traps)

🚫 “AI predicts collisions with 97% accuracy”
→ meaningless without context

🚫 Over-complex deep learning with no explanation
→ managers don’t trust black boxes

🚫 Raw collision counts without exposure adjustment
→ instantly challenged by reviewers

---

## 🧩 Ideal Portfolio (If I Were You)

If I had to pick **three** to showcase:

1. **Location-based collision risk scoring (map)**
2. **Severe injury/fatality prediction with explainable drivers**
3. **Class 1 vs non-Class 1 adjusted risk model**

That combo says:

> *“I can predict risk, explain why, and inform policy.”*
